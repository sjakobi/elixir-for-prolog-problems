Elixir solutions for Werner Hett's Prolog Problems
==================================================

This repository contains solutions for the popular `Prolog Problems`_ by
Werner Hett written in Elixir_. 

Where the problem specification differed from Elixir customs I preferred to go
the Elixir way:

- Indexing is zero-based (or should be!)
- When the output of a function is a collection of a fixed length and structure
  I prefer to go with tuples rather than lists.

Feel free to contribute and improve existing solutions or add new ones!
