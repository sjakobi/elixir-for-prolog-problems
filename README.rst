Elixir solutions for Werner Hett's Prolog Problems
--------------------------------------------------

This repository contains solutions for the popular
`Prolog Problems <https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems>` by
Werner Hett written in https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir[Elixir]. 

In some cases I decided to go with Elixir customs rather than the suggested
Prolog way:
- Indexing is zero-based (or should be!)
- When the output of a function is a collection of a fixed length and structure
  I prefer to go with tuples rather than lists.

Feel free to contribute and improve existing solutions or add new ones!
